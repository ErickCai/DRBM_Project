> rbm.py a python class that implements an RBM. It supports the binary and gaussion type of RBMs. We added to it another type, in order to include the Replicated Softmax Model of RBMs.
> dbm.py a python class that implements a Deep Boltzmann Machine. It is implemented as stacked RBMs. 
> run_flickr_text_dbm.ipynb is the python script that trains the text specific Deep Boltzmann Machine.
> run flickr image dbm.ipynb is the python script that trains the image specific Deep Boltzmann Machine.
> run_flickr_multimodal_dbm.ipynb is the python script that implements the multimodal Deep Boltzmann Machine using the weights learned from the two precedent scripts.
